# unserCMS
UnserCMS is a lightweight MIT Licence software that gives you a small footprint CMS with customizable modules to be added onto it.
UnserCMS grows from our clients' needs to create a unique CMS that is based on open source technologies. Our philosophy is to create the best installation for each client, so that usability and system efficiency is the best. Hence our deployment is divided into a lot of different modules you can combine, when installing it.

UnserCMS is NOT for end user, but rather for developers who want to create interactive solutions that don't fit into the scope of other on-the-market products.

We are happy about all contribution and please feel free to contact us!
